# Bank_Account

I used State pattern to implement a simple bank account. An account (class BankAccount) can be opened (using the constructor BankAccount()) and has an initial balance of 0. An account has the state Positive, if its balance is greater than or equal to 0. If the balance is lower than 0, the account is Negative. Money is added to the account by using the method payIn() and withdrawn by calling payOff().

An account can be overdrawn by the amount of the overdraft credit that is specified when the account is opened (field lineOfCredit). If the accountâ€™s balance reaches its lowest limit, no money can be withdrawn anymore until the next call of payIn(). The account now has the state Frozen and calls to payOff() should return false.

Calls of the method payOff(), that would exceed the lineOfCredit, are unsuccessful and should return false.

An account can only be closed (BankAccount.close()), if its balance is 0. After that the account enters the state Closed where no money can be payed in or off anymore. Any attempt to do so should return false.

If the method payInterest() is called, the interest is payed. That means in the state Positive 1% of the balance is added. If the state is Negative the balance is decreased by another 3% and in the state Frozen 5% are subtracted. Interest always needs to be paid, so there is no exception if the balance exceeds the lineOfCredit.

Information about the current balance and state can be aquired by calling printBalance(). Take a look at the following example output:

BankAccount account = new BankAccount("0815", 20);

account.payIn(10)
account.printBalance()  // Balance is POSITIVE: +10.0.

account.payOff(20)
account.printBalance()  // Balance is NEGATIVE: -10.0.

account.payOff(10)
account.printBalance()  // Balance is NEGATIVE: -20.0. You need to pay in money.

account.payIn(20)
account.printBalance()  // Balance is POSITIVE: +0.0.

account.close()
account.printBalance()  // This account is CLOSED. The balance is 0.
